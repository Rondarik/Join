<h2>What is Join?</h2>
<p>
    <span class="highlicht">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part 
    of their web development<br> bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.

    and maximize<br> efficiency (or flow). <span class="highlicht">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects 
    in an intuitive, visual<br> interface.

<h2>How to use it</h2>
<p>
    Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="highlicht">Join</span>:
</p>
<div class="list_container">
<p class="number">1.</p>
<p><b>Exploring the Board</b>
    <br>When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. 
    This board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do",<br> "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
</p>
</div>

<div class="list_container">
    <p class="number">2.</p>
    <p><b>Creating Contacts</b>
        <br>In <span class="highlicht">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects.
        Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in<br> the required information. Once added, 
        these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the<br> board.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="list_container">
        <p class="number">3.</p>
        <p><b>Adding Cards</b>
            <br> Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
            Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under <br>the appropriate
            list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,<br> etc.
        </p>
        </div>
     
    <div class="list_container">
        <p class="number">4.</p>
        <p><b>Moving Cards</b>
        <br> As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging
        and dropping the card from one<br> list to another.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="list_container">
            <p class="number">5.</p>
            <p><b>Deleting Cards</b>
            <br> Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
            Deleting a card will permanently remove it from<br> the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, 
            as this action is irreversible.
            </p>
            </div>

    Remember that using <span class="highlicht">Join</span> effectively requires consistent
