        <p>You may at any time lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, e.g., the competent supervisory authority of the federal <br>state of your residence or the authority responsible for us as the responsible entity.</p>
        <p>A list of supervisory authorities (for the non-public sector) with addresses can be found at:<br> <a class="longLink" href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Service/Anschriften/Laender/Laender-node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Service/Anschriften/Laender/Laender-node.html</a>.</p>

<h2>Collection of general information when visiting our website</h2>
<h3>Nature and purpose of processing:</h3>
<p>When you access our website, i.e., if you do not register or otherwise provide information, information of a general nature is<br> automatically recorded. This information (server log files) includes, for example, the type of web browser, the operating system used,<br> the domain name of your Internet service provider, your IP address, and similar.</p>
<p>They are processed in particular for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring a smooth connection setup of the website,</li>
<li>Ensuring smooth use of our website,</li>
<li>Evaluating system security and stability, as well as</li>
<li>optimizing our website.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not use your data to draw conclusions about your person. Information of this kind is evaluated statistically by us, if necessary,<br> anonymously, in order to optimize our website and the technology behind it.</p>
<h3>Legal basis and legitimate interest:</h3>
<p>Processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR on the basis of our legitimate interest in improving the stability<br> and functionality of our website.</p>

<h3>Recipient:</h3>
<p>The recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as processors for the operation and maintenance of our website.</p>
<p></p><h3>Storage duration:</h3>
<p>The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of collection. This is generally the case for data that serves<br> the provision of the website when the respective session is ended.</p>
<p>In the case of data stored in log files, this is the case after at most 14 days. Further storage is possible. In this case, the IP addresses<br> of the users are anonymized, so that an assignment of the calling client is no longer possible.</p>
<p></p><h3>Provision required or necessary:</h3>
<p>The provision of the aforementioned personal data is neither legally nor contractually required. However, without the IP address,<br> the service and functionality of our website are not guaranteed. In addition, individual services and features may not be available<br> or may be restricted. Therefore, an objection is excluded.</p>
<p></p><h2>Contact Form</h2>
<h3>Nature and purpose of processing:</h3>
<p>The data you enter will be stored for the purpose of individual communication with you. For this purpose, providing a valid email address<br> and your name is necessary. This serves to assign the request and subsequently respond to it. Providing additional data is optional.</p>
<h3>Legal basis:</h3>
<p>The processing of the data entered into the contact form is based on a legitimate interest (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR).</p>
<p>By providing the contact form, we aim to facilitate uncomplicated contact. The information you provide will be stored for the purpose of <br>processing the request and for possible follow-up questions.</p>
<p>If you contact us to request an offer, the processing of the data entered into the contact form will be carried out to perform<br> pre-contractual measures (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR).</p>
<h3>Recipient:</h3>
<p>The recipients of the data may be processors.</p>

<p></p><h3>Data Storage Duration:</h3>
<p>Data will be deleted no later than 6 months after processing the request.</p>
<p>If a contractual relationship is established, we are subject to the statutory retention periods according to the German Commercial Code<br> (HGB) and will delete your data after the expiration of these periods.</p>
<h3>Provision Required or Necessary:</h3>
<p>The provision of your personal data is voluntary. However, we can only process your request if you provide us with your name,<br> email address, and the reason for the request.</p>
<h2>Information about Your Right to Object under Article 21 of the GDPR</h2>
<h3>Case-by-Case Right to Object</h3>

<p>You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of personal data concerning <br>you which is based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (processing for the purposes of legitimate interests); this also applies to profiling based on<br> this provision within the meaning of Article 4(4) GDPR.</p>
<p>If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing<br> which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or the processing serves the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>
<h3>Recipient of an Objection</h3>
<p>Mevlida Salendrkovic, Marcus Harder, Bennedikt Messler and Sergen Selcik</p>
